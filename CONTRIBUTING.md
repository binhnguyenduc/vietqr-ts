## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/vietqr-ts.git
   cd vietqr-ts
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/binhnguyenduc/vietqr-ts.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- npm 9.x or later

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Run type checking
npm run type-check
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run type-check
   npm run lint
   npm test
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** following the commit guidelines

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request** from your fork to the main repository

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript typing - no `any` types unless absolutely necessary
- Enable all strict compiler options (already configured in `tsconfig.json`)
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Document complex logic with comments

### Code Style

- Follow the ESLint configuration (`.eslintrc`)
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add trailing commas in multi-line objects/arrays
- Maximum line length: 100 characters (soft limit)

### File Organization

- Place new features in appropriate directories:
  - `src/generators/` - QR generation logic
  - `src/parsers/` - QR parsing logic
  - `src/validators/` - Validation rules
  - `src/decoders/` - Image decoding logic
  - `src/utils/` - Utility functions
  - `src/types/` - TypeScript type definitions

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Requirements

- All new features **must** include tests
- Bug fixes **must** include regression tests
- Maintain minimum 95% code coverage
- Tests must pass before submitting PR

### Writing Tests

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { yourFunction } from '../path/to/module';

describe('YourFeature', () => {
  it('should handle valid input correctly', () => {
    const result = yourFunction(validInput);
    expect(result).toEqual(expectedOutput);
  });

  it('should throw error for invalid input', () => {
    expect(() => yourFunction(invalidInput)).toThrow('Expected error message');
  });
});
```

### Test Organization

- Place tests in `tests/` directory, mirroring `src/` structure
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Group related tests using `describe` blocks
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates

### Examples

```bash
feat(parser): add support for additional data field 62

fix(validator): correct CRC checksum validation logic

docs(readme): update API examples with error handling

test(generator): add tests for edge cases in amount formatting
```

## Pull Request Process
